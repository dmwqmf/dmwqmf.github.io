                Destiny has been caddying for seven years at Flossmoor Country Club in Flossmoor, IL. 
                Since 2015, Destiny has completed over 400+ rounds of golf. 
                Caddying offers an excellent opportunity to earn money while working flexible hours, especially for young adults. 
                A round of golf usually takes four hours to complete. There are many duties of a caddie. A few responsibilities include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping the golf clubs and equipment clean</li>
                    <li>Reading green</li>
                    <li>Raking bunkers</li>
                    <li>Finding the golf ball after it has been struck</li>
                </ul>
                Skills such as customer service, effective communication, and course knowledge are also needed to complete an adequate job as a caddie.
                <br><br>
                <b class="yellow-bold">Reflection:</b>
                Becoming a caddie was one of the first experiences I utilized the skills of communication, leadership, and work ethic in a professional work setting. 
                I offered shadow and mentee opportunities to beginner caddies during her seven years as a caddy. 
                This is where my skills were put to the test. Being a caddie taught me many soft skills and has helped me grow professionally.</div>
