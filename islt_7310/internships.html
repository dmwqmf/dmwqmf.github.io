                <b class="yellow-bold">Reflection:</b>
                PwC has given me a new way to think about agile planning and managerial skills. 
                I picked up a new skill of quickly adapting to project changes oriented toward client work. 
                The culture of PwC has allowed me to strengthen my values as a student and employee, but also expand my perspective of my role in the company.
