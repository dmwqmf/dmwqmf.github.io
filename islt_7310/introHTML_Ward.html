    Hello everyone, my name is Destiny Ward, and I am a senior IT major from the South Suburbs of Chicago. 
    I have previous web application experience. In the Spring of 2021, I took the course INFOTC 2830 here at Mizzou. 
    I got a chance to gain experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and a small portion of SQL. 
    I expect this course to review concepts of HTML and CSS, such as setting up a website, various layouts, and fundamentals of color and media. 
    I hope to learn other concepts not taught in INFOTC 2830, such as quick tips or tricks that can be used when working with HTML and CSS. 
    I don't necessarily have any hobbies at the moment. One hobby I want to try is knitting a blanket sometime this fall. 
    I like to work out, listen to music, and hang out with friends and family in my free time.
