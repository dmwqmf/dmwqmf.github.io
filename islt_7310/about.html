            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is Destiny Ward, and I am a senior IT major from the South Suburbs of Chicago. 
                I have previous web application experience. In the Spring of 2021, I took the course INFOTC 2830 here at Mizzou. 
                I got a chance to gain experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and a small portion of SQL. 
                I expect this course to review concepts of HTML and CSS, such as setting up a website, various layouts, and fundamentals of color and media. 
                I hope to learn other concepts not taught in INFOTC 2830, such as quick tips or tricks that can be used when working with HTML and CSS. 
                I don't necessarily have any hobbies at the moment. One hobby I want to try is knitting a blanket sometime this fall. 
                I like to work out, listen to music, and hang out with friends and family in my free time.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Destiny's education journey begins with a high school diploma from Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, IL. 
                Currently, Destiny is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
                As of now, she has not declared a specialized focus but enjoys front-end web development and digital media design. 
                Her estimated graduation date and undergraduate completion is Spring 2023 at the University of Missouri-Columbia. 
                She holds undergraduate certifications in Media Technology and Design and Cybersecurity. 
                Destiny is on track to complete her Crosby MBA program with a certificate in global supply chain management in Spring 2024 at the University of Missouri-Columbia. 
                While completing her bachelor's degree, Destiny is simultaneously enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student and part-time graduate student. 
                If you are an ambitious person, it is important to remember that:
