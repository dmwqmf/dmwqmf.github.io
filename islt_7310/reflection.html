                My career experiences so far do not feel traditional or fixed. 
                I began my first job and career at the age of 15. 
                This exposure allowed me to gain leadership and efficient communication skills at an early age. 
                With this knowledge, I gained experience on how to network, practice business acumen, and bring my whole self to work. Since my first job, I have matured even more professionally. 
                My career journey continues to excel, and I am consistently introduced to new skills and approaches.

                <div class="section b">
                Academic courses and programs have gotten easier to adjust to as I have academically advanced to each grade level. 
                Techniques and management skills have become easier to grasp and apply to course material. 
                When faced with adversity in courses and programs, I reached out to the resources provided, such as professors and tutoring. 
                The academic studies I have taken at Mizzou, such as intro to VR, web development, and motion graphics and visual effects, have helped me obtain a broad perspective of technology. 
                Reflecting on my academic journey, I am proud of my work ethic and commitment to learning core technology concepts.

                <div class="section c">
                My career goals include finding adequate work while maintaining my finances and balancing investments. 
                Finding good work means more than finding a suitable job; but that work that fulfills me. 
                Moreover, I would like to expand on my knowledge within my career to prepare me for my future endeavors of wanting to manage IT companies. 
                Balancing investments is another career goal of mine, as I would like to assist small businesses in scaling into more expansive markets. 
                Assisting small businesses is essential to me as it helps my community flourish and brings more resources to my community.

                <div class="section d">
                Another prevalent goal in my life is assisting the life of black adolescents that come from low-income communities. 
                This is important to me while visiting home this summer. 
                I took notice of the numerous disadvantages that the students in my high school faced. I would like to equip them with a social network to help them excel and prepare them for post-high school life. 
                Many aren't aware of scholarships or jobs they can apply for after high school, leaving them thinking they only have a few options. 
                Overall, I would like for my life to mean something; everything I do and say is in respect to my next goal and working to excel in life.
