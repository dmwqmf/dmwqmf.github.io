                <b class="yellow-bold">Peer Learning Assistant (PLA) – January 2021 – Present</b><br><br>
                A Peer Learning Assistant (PLA) assists a professor in a classroom setting. 
                PLAs facilitate projects, small group discussions, and aid during laboratory activities. 
                In addition to these tasks, PLAs grade online homework assignments and hold three weekly office hours that lead discussions over class material. 
                The total committed hours per week are ten, which includes class time. 
                Destiny is a PLA for the Department of Information Technology courses Intro to Digital Media Design and Motion Graphic and Visual Effects. 
                First- and second-year students usually take these courses within the College of Engineering or digital storytelling majors. PLAs can be compensated by salary or federal work-study.

                <b class="yellow-bold">Reflection:</b>
                Being a PLA as a second job was a step forward in the right direction for my career. 
                I could apply the soft skills I gained while caddying in this setting. 
                Peer learning assistant duties have taught me how to solve real-world problems and find the best solutions while maintaining academic integrity.
